# Set this to your favorite markdown formatter, eg., kmarkdown (fltr_cache
# takes as an argument a filter, in the default configuration kmarkdown, that
# caches output). Note that some kwerc components assume a markdown-like
# formatter, but all major functionality should should be formatter agnostic.
# Note kmarkdown includes a sanitizer for user-generated markdown -- if you
# change the formatter and you are getting markdown from untrusted users, make
# sure you have a sanitizer!
