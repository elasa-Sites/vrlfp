<h2>Why VR dating?</h2>
<h3>Date more</h3>
<p>We get it. You can't date everyone you meet on Tinder. You need to budget your time and money. Some people are serial killers. Some people are far away. So you play games, flip coins, and spend hours coming up with lame pickup lines.</p>

<p>Hold up. Are we rejecting potential partners based on a text or two? Don't we have the technology to converse with more than plain text? (No, emojis and GIFs don't count.) Uh, yeah, we do.</p>

<p>So try dating with VRLFP. Grab a coffee, visit an amusement park, or go to the moon without leaving your home and without spending a dime.</p>

<h3>Be safe</h3>

<p>Not having fun? Just block your date and take off your headset.</p>

<p><em>That said, do be careful divulging personal information to other users on VRLFP. In particular, consider using a new username. <a href="/terms">We are not responsible for other users.</a></em></p>

<h3>Screw geography</h3>
<p>Don't limit yourself to the boring people in your town. VR makes long-distance relationships work. If you can do something IRL, you can probably do it in VR. If you can't do something IRL, you can probably still do it in VR. Oh yeah, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics">teledildonics</a> exist.</p>
